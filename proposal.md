# DAO Watch Automation Tool - Project Proposal

## 1. Project Vision

The DAO Watch Automation Tool aims to streamline and automate the research and organization process for the DAO Watch content series. By leveraging AI and integration with productivity tools, we will create a system that drastically reduces manual effort while improving data quality and workflow efficiency.

### Goals

- Reduce manual research time by 70%
- Ensure consistent and accurate proposal data
- Create a scalable system that grows with the series
- Provide a seamless, user-friendly experience
- Build a reliable repository of DAO governance information

## 2. Problem Statement

Currently, researching and organizing DAO governance proposals involves:
- Manual discovery and data extraction
- Time-consuming copy-pasting between platforms
- Inconsistent formatting and organization
- Risk of human error in data collection
- Limited scalability as the series grows

This process consumes valuable time that could be better spent on content creation and analysis.

## 3. Solution Architecture

### Technical Stack

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify

#### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **API Integration**: Perplexity AI, Notion API
- **Deployment**: AWS Lambda or similar serverless solution

#### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User submits proposal links via frontend
2. **Processing**: Backend uses Perplexity AI to extract structured data
3. **Validation**: User reviews and confirms extracted data
4. **Storage**: Validated data is sent to Notion via API
5. **Organization**: Proposals are grouped by episode in Notion

### System Components

#### Link Submission Module
- Multi-link input field with batch processing
- Link validation and deduplication
- Episode assignment dropdown
- Episode metadata configuration (status, priority, archived)

#### AI Processing Engine
- URL parsing and content extraction
- Perplexity AI integration for data extraction
- Adaptive rules for different DAO platforms
- Structured data extraction for all required fields

#### Data Validation Interface
- Editable fields for AI-extracted data
- Preview of final structured output
- Batch submission to Notion
- Comprehensive proposal data editing

#### Notion Integration Layer
- Structured API calls
- Database schema matching
- Error handling and retry logic
- Formatted episode template generation

#### User Management System
- OAuth authentication
- Session management
- User preferences

### Notion Data Structure

The system generates content in a standardized format for Notion, including:

#### Episode Information
- Episode Name
- Status (In Progress, Done, Planned)
- Priority (Yes, No)
- Archived status

#### Proposal Details
- DAO Name
- Proposal Title
- Single Sentence Summary
- Amount Requested
- Total Budget
- Daily Volume
- Pros and Cons analysis
- Voting Recommendation
- Status (Active, Passed, Rejected)
- Voting Deadline
- Original link

#### Additional Content
- Overview & Purpose section
- Introduction template
- Timestamps for video editing
- Marketing routine checklist
- Social media post templates

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (1-2 months)
- Basic frontend with proposal link submission
- Core backend for AI processing
- Simple Notion integration
- Manual error handling

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (1 month)
- Improved UI/UX with mobile optimization
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Historical logging of processed proposals
- Basic notification system

### Phase 3: Scaling & Optimization (1 month)
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced user feedback mechanisms
- Expanded Notion integration features
- Enhanced data visualization

### Phase 4: Future Extensions (Ongoing)
- API for third-party integrations

- Machine learning for improved data extraction

## 5. Success Metrics

We will measure success through:
- Reduction in time spent on research (target: 70% decrease)
- Accuracy of extracted data (target: >95%)
- User satisfaction ratings (target: >4.5/5)
- System uptime and reliability (target: >99.5%)
- Growth in processed proposals (target: support for 3x current volume)

## 6. Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1-2 Frontend Developers (React.js expertise)
- 1-2 Backend Developers (Node.js, API integration experience)
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 Project Manager / Product Owner

### Infrastructure
- Cloud hosting (AWS/Vercel)
- API access (Perplexity AI, Notion)
- Development and testing environments
- CI/CD pipeline

### Budget Considerations
- Development time: ~400-600 hours
- API usage costs (Perplexity AI)
- Hosting and infrastructure
- Ongoing maintenance

## 7. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API limitations | High | Build caching mechanisms, implement rate limiting, have fallback options |
| Data extraction accuracy | Medium | Implement thorough validation, manual override options |
| Security concerns | High | Use OAuth, secure API key storage, regular security audits |
| Scaling issues | Medium | Design for scalability from start, load testing, elastic infrastructure |
| Notion format changes | Medium | Design adaptable Notion templates, maintain version compatibility |

## 8. Future Roadmap

### Near-term Enhancements
- Advanced filtering and searching of proposals
- Customizable data fields
- Integration with calendar tools for deadline tracking
- Browser extension for easier proposal submission
- Custom Notion templates

### Long-term Vision
- Expanded AI capabilities for proposal analysis
- Community features for collaborative research
- Public API for ecosystem integration
- Analytics and trend identification across DAOs
- Automated social media content generation

## 9. Conclusion

The DAO Watch Automation Tool represents a significant opportunity to transform the content creation workflow for the DAO Watch series. By automating tedious research tasks and creating a structured repository of governance data, we enable the team to focus on what they do best: creating insightful, valuable content about DAO governance.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to building a tool that not only solves immediate pain points but creates a foundation for future growth and innovation. With a phased implementation approach, we can deliver value quickly while building toward an increasingly sophisticated solution.
